<blockquote>
  <p>Writing this at 4:40am after a day of 3 AP exams. Slept too early.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been thinking about whether exams make someone a better person. They are stressful. They can corrupt a love for learning.</p>

<p>But they also teach dealing with a stress in a relatively low-pressure, stable environment. The task at hand is extremely well defined, sometimes you are even given a guide to prepare, and nothing (no monetary outcomes) are at risk if you fail. However, for a job - high-stakes situations arise without warnings, unstructured, and can be mired in political capital problems. Thus, are exams the training wheels for adolescents to deal with these times later?</p>

<p>Furthermore, in these exams those who either studied the most, were the smartest, or cheated typically do best. It may feel discouraging to see those who barely studied get an A compared when you worked much harder. Again, not a good reason to &lt;3 exams. But isn’t this also realistic of how performance goes in the career “real-world”?</p>

<p>So to go back to this (argumentative essay) prompt - no, exams don’t make you a better person. Or I could argue that (for me at least), taking hard exams (and doing well on them) does make me more confident to take on harder, stressful challenges. But an <em>N=1</em> sample is too small to generalize, so I’m going to stick for no today.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that exams are preparation of something more in a heavily controlled environment. And I think it’s going to be a long-time until we can evaluate a person’s skills in a situation that doesn’t involve an exam (e.g. reading their brain flows and chemicals) as accurately. So might as well try to frame tests as something nice for the interim time.</p>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>A lot of times in our life, we reflect more on what isn’t going well and not what is. It may feel like everything fails at the worst moment - however, we rarely acknowledge all the things that did go well, or by contrast worked and did not succeed. For example, during a test we will underestimate how many we got wrong because we spent so much more time on questions we didn’t know the answer to. Part of this makes sense though - we expect staples to staples in them, computers to charge when we plug them in, and phones to work (we expect things to work.)</p>

<p>In light of this idea of <em>gratitude</em>, one idea I had was to keep a rolling list of all the things I’ve seen that have luckily gone in a favorable direction. That way, I’ll pay more attention to what is working than just what isn’t.</p>

<h2 id="lucky-nice-things">Lucky Nice Things</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Important Account Online for me has its password, not entire account, expire</li>
  <li>The Test Question did not ask about simulations</li>
  <li>The MCQ was Free</li>
  <li>Only lost a year due to COVID-19</li>
  <li>Practice Tests Haven’t Asked About Holes in a Conductor</li>
  <li>The company I work at doesn’t focus on engineering as much as research</li>
  <li>I was able to conduct an independent project, instead of continue an existing one</li>
  <li>Admin didn’t kick us out even though we didn’t formally sign up to run the event</li>

<p>One thing that’s been on my mind for a while now is why the internet has taken form in the way that it has. Why is United States the country with the highest GDP? Why did they choose a different shade of blue and typeface for different parts of the chapstick container that will be not noticed by 99% of users? Why am I born at this station of status in the world?</p>

<p>Too often, we don’t don’t ask enough questions. There’s a lack of questioning of why the world acts in the way it does and why it arrived at this specific state out of an infinite amount. I’m pretty sure this is because in such a highly structured and organized society, we don’t realize the bigger picture that the single planet we are engrossed in comprises of man-made concepts. The world is deterministic to some extent. I can’t find the eraser at school because I forgot it. It’s not in multiple positions as we may think, it’s in one.</p>

<p>There’s so much for us to question. The Pacific Ocean isn’t real, country lines are imaginary, money has no intrinsic value. So much of the prejudice around us in baseless and crumbles under reasoning of “WHY”? How have humans been able to create fake illusions that now are considered as real as the earth itself? In our origins where we could die at any minute, why do we celebrate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_effect">birthdays</a> - are we proud to survive another year or cheering away the fact that we are closer to our death :skull:?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alan Kay: “The Internet was done so well that most people think of it as a natural resource like the Pacific Ocean, rather than something that was man-made”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, is pondering the current state of the world even worth it? If scientists are correctly, we are one in infinite parallel universes - just a <em>permutation</em> of what could have occurred over the span of all time. Why debilitate over whether we need to change when life is getting better (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190111-seven-reasons-why-the-world-is-improving">overall</a>)? If our world’s state, configuration, policies, whatever is just one in an infinite amount - is it even important?</p>

<p>But if it’s the only one in this shape - can we not also conclude with a 0% p-value that this configuration is sacred in a way? Like, the trajectory of how the world evolves that we are part of is significant (maybe the best, the worst, or some other distinguisher)? With a infinite amount of paths to take, is the road that we have taken special?</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about this especially after reading <em>Grendel</em> for my school’s APLAC class. In <em>Grendel</em>, the rich dragon criticizes the beast at his ignorance of the world. In particular, he mentions that the fact a certain object (e.g. a jug) has been repeatedly made proves its inherent value; after all it was that particular configuration of atoms (from an infinite set) repeated many times that shows it’s too significant to ignore. Similarly, our policies &amp; ideas may be significant, holy decisions as we continue to practice the same rules again and again, like monetary and fiscal policy.</p>

<p>Nobody knows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Writing this with a C in APLAC lmao. Now a B. Now an A. lmao.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our school recently encountered a power outage where we got a good amount time off from school. When the announcement came, I was surprised to see how prevalent the belief that students-must-hate-school stuck (I am somewhat guilty of this, but in my defense it meant I didn’t have a quiz tomorrow). Everybody cheered because there was less school, as if the fact that school was bad was dogma and self-evident. Well, I don’t hate school and thus here this <del>💩post</del> goes.</p>

<h2 id="meeting-people">Meeting People</h2>

<p>No, the first reason is not learning. I am not that corny/predictable (for now).</p>

<p>Despite the striking lack of diversity my 90% Asian high school has, there’s a good amount of varied attitudes and people. It’s not hard to find math nerds five feet away from students blasting music and playing spikeball. As part of going to school, I enjoy chance interactions/conversations and making as many jokes, however degenerate, as possible. Collaborations &amp; opportunities all come from exposure to people outside your “bubble” - I find you only (or at least for me) get that from talking to different people. Futhermore, it’s always interesting to learn about people and what they spend their time on precisely because sometimes I could never imagine myself doing what they do. I will sometimes even pretend that a door is not open just to start a conversation with whoever will open it 💀.</p>

<p>These chance conversations literally whenever - during class, passing periods, walking to and from school - are already a good enough why to go to school. Regardless of how much sleep I got the last night, meeting new faces who eventually become friends makes school worth it.</p>

<h2 id="shared-suffering">Shared Suffering</h2>

<p>OK, so I’ve been talking about how I like school but now state that in it we <em>suffer</em>? Let me elucidate (as my english teacher says).</p>

<p>Getting screwed week after week with hard tests in tough classes, as far as I’ve seen, generally brings people together. I’ve noticed that the hardest classes usually create the best bonds as everybody tries to prepare for the upcoming test. I would argue that is part of the reason that students actually enjoy harder classes than those easier (assuming it works out for them). For some reason it can be embarrassing to admit, but we do like learning.</p>

<h2 id="generally-useful-information">Generally Useful Information?</h2>

<p>Starting with a quick disclaimer that I am in awkward position to praise the American public education school system as a student at a high school ranked in the top 100 in the US and top 10 in California.</p>

<p>But as far as I have seen, most of the information we learn in school is NOT useless. Gaining a broad foundation across disciplines is valuable at an age (&lt;20) where it cannot be expected (in first-world countries) that we should know what we want to dedicate time to. I do think there is value in being able to understand the world around us, which school addresses somewhat completely - how the world formed around us (history), provable truths about our world (sciences), what our world &amp; collective psyche is based on (language classes). It’s <em>not</em> bad.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I’d say most students would happily take two weeks off from school if given the choice but then secretly want to return in a month or so. Would anybody ask to restart school? Idk.</p>

<p><del>It’s been a minute since I’ve updated this thing.</del> Today I woke up with a pretty fun dream. I found a secret part of my high school filled with California Scrub-Jays (my favorite bird :D) and rushed to take photographs of them. On that note, why not write an article on my observations and techniques for photographing birds ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<h2 id="common-reason-for-failed-photographs">Common Reason for Failed Photographs</h2>

<p>Leaves. Branches. More leaves. Half the time these things become the area of focus for my camera lens instead of the fast-moving birds I am going to capture. Therefore, always try to find a clearing or area where no leaves/branches are in front of the bird (in the background as scenery is not a problem).</p>

<p>Another common reason for a bird photograph is cause the bird flies off. Here’s how to avoid that.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-prevent-the-bird-from-flying-off">How To Prevent The Bird From Flying Off</h2>

<p>To some extent, the motions of a bird are out of control. However, simple things like not talking near the bird or not making too loud steps are controllable. Only approach a still bird further <em>after</em> taking a photograph of it. It doesn’t make sense to give up your guaranteed picture in hopes of a more close-up picture.</p>

<p>Avoid shaking the branches of the bird either as that tends to make the birds go away. Of course, this stuff all sounds obvious but I’m not lying when I say there is a spidey sense to know when a bird will disappear a split-second before it happens.</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-bird-photograph">What makes a good bird photograph?</h2>

<p>I’m not the best in photographing these creatures but the main thing I’ve noticed is that having the face (and both eyes) is extremely crucial. We look at bird photographs somewhat in the same way as humans. Having as much focus on the bird’s face - and the emotion created by the bird’s hopeful glance as it turns its head - is extremely important.</p>

<h2 id="why-bird-photography-is-enjoyable">Why Bird Photography is Enjoyable</h2>

<p>Bird photography (at least for an amateur like me) is a little bit like monopoly. There’s undeniable skill, but undeniable luck as well. Sometimes I get multiple of my best photographs ever from one trip (Alaska 👀) and sometimes return borderline empty-handed. But there are things to improve upon - better aim of the camera, the ability to recognize birds faster, being able to shift lens focus in a split-second, knowing which birds show when - there is a reason we have photographs like <a href="https://images.theoutdoorwire.com/2019/12/04/45d848cc-63f8-43ae-8692-f47e960cfc54_600x476.jpg">these</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore observing birds as they hop around free while you stress about APLAC is oddly annoying and reassuring at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It’s not as boring as it sounds. Also peep the amateur <a href="/notes/bay-area-birds-field-guide.pdf">field guide</a> I made for Bay Area birds.</p>
