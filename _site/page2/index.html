        Naps

    <span class="post-date">22 Feb 2023</span>

<p>Having ~1.5 years of experience with napping, I think I have am pro enough to have some insights. In fact, I just took a 10min nap at 12:00 (pm!) so that I could get myself to study electric potential &amp; voltage. Naps are typically taken wrong but are also pretty dangerous if you don’t take them right. Here’s to everything I know about naps on 2/23/2023 at 2:14am.</p>

<h1 id="benefits">Benefits</h1>

<h2 id="energy-saver">Energy Saver</h2>

<p>The rationale for taking a nap is the idea of admitting that you will not be productive if you do not take a nap. For example, after arriving from school I am pretty certain I will not immediately do homework and instead just browse YouTube. If on average I estimate I will waste 20 minutes of watching YouTube, which not only will drain my energy by being on a scren but also lose motivation to get through homework without watching YouTube - it makes no sense to avoid YouTube altogether. Instead, taking a 20-30 minute nap is ideal for productivity. By accepting that you need a break as an inevitable, taking a nap means not only that you get that break but that break actually will lead to increased focus/motivation/patience for BS after you wakeup. It’s sort of like making a contract like I’m going to kill X minutes but will immediately be productive after. In reality, it’s worth sacrificing 20-30 minutes for 30minutes of work at 95% productivity compared to 15 minutes of YouTube at 50-75% productivity levels.</p>

<h2 id="day-breaker">Day Breaker</h2>

<p>Naps, especially those of 20-30min taken in the afternoon after something intensive like school, allow for the brain to shut down. This essentially means that after waking up from the nap, memory of what happened before the nap will suffer. Thus, what you just did an hour ago in school will seem distant and somewhat feel like a completely different day. Also, if you are a “morning person” (inceased productivity after waking up) - ig waking up more in a day can only be useful then?? Or instead you like sleeping/dreaming (or the feeling of normal force supporting your side), naps can give you a way to sleep more with the pretense of “productivity”. I’ve had a good amount of times when while napping I feel like I am awake with eyes open - it’s always pretty fun.</p>

<h2 id="escape-from-reality">Escape from Reality</h2>
<p>Naps are a great way to escape your problems.</p>

<h2 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h2>
<p>Naps can really screw you up. For one, if you lack self-control and extend your nap to more than 1 hour, your basically screwing up the time when your body will want you to sleep. Second, I guess people feel unproductive taking naps or something? I guess you just have to really believe that 20min of dead time outweighs switching back-and-forth tabs with distractions for 30min of work.</p>

  <p>This article was made at 2am. I will update as I become more aware of my own observations and discover more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s been a while since I’ve posted and I figure I should. I’ve made a series of observations in my life which are undoubtedly true (I may be biased ;) but generally seem to prove themselves true time and time again. Whether that is a self-fulfilling prophecy of me believing in my own BS, I do not know.</p>

<h2 id="experiences-can-not-be-repeated-twice">Experiences Can Not Be Repeated Twice</h2>

<p>I remember when I was younger, visiting a beach in Europe. It was pretty fun to be in the waves and all day. The next day, I wanted to have exactly what I had yesterday - a nice day on the sand - but the tides were going crazy and the weather was cloudy and gloomy. From that experience in itself around ~7 years ago, I’ve come to realize that any memory cannot be repeated more than once. Time is a monotonically increasing function - you cannot go back - to the first time you listented to your favorite song, read your favorite book, or had a genuinely good time.</p>

<p>What this implies is the idea of <em>living in the moment</em> as being necessary to experience life better. If we are having a fun, spontaneous time, we have to be smart enough to realize that 1) we are having fun and that 2) this time will never come again in its pure, natural form and thus the best thing that can be done is to make it the best time of our lives. If this seems too idealistic for you, here’s a simpler one - just next time you find a song that hits your ears in a nice way just try to listen to that song only because the pleasure you get from its novelties, unexpected beats, etc. will die with each listen.</p>

<h2 id="useful-vs-useless-arguments">Useful vs. Useless Arguments</h2>

<p>Today, I remember seeing an argument about who was the most oppressed/privileged/etc. demographic throughout history. This may seem obvious, but regardless of how won - there would be no real winner because they are really just fighting for approval over an opinion not over policy. Useless arguments argue over opinions, useful arguments argue over policy. Try to aim for useful arguments.</p>

<h2 id="implicit-order-of-the-world">Implicit Order of the World</h2>

<p>For this mysterious thing called <em>prestige</em>, there seems to be an implicit order of the world. The world is full of diverse people yet at the same time follows predictable, statistically-significant patterns en masse: students offered a selection of universities generally choose some over others, certain countries are seen as just “better” (e.g. America) despite growing bodies of evidence saying anything but. Rankings for companies change yearly and yet the same implicit order of which companies are more prestigious stay - there is a general inertia for learnt rankings to change when they are founded on unstated social assumptions and not facts.</p>

<h2 id="things-are-more-deterministic-than-we-realize">Things are more deterministic than we realize</h2>

<p>My desk right now is an absolute mess. It is completely disorganized and there are random pens everywhere. I can’t even tell you how I got to this state. But it is deterministc. When I search for something, like a pen, that I will inevitably lose in this mess, I can guarantee I will try to search for multiple different locations. This is fine, but it’s better for me to realize there’s a reason why it’s the place it is beyond the fact that I “lost” it. The principle that things are the way they are for a reason (deterministic in machine learning) is an interesting one. It’s also why I love APLAC - reading masterpieces where every word was chosen deliberately means that there is a neverending supply of critical thinking and digging to be done.</p>

<h2 id="your-music-taste-is-not-really-unique">Your Music Taste Is Not (Really) Unique</h2>

<p>(Might just be me.) I am always hungry about songs. It is always super funny to see how an unfamiliar song with a slightly weird name but a lot of streams slowly goes from something I completely don’t resonate or feel is part of my taste to my playlist. Time and time again, I have seen that whatever my initial reaction to the song - <em>I am not unique</em> - I probably will find myself liking it. This means that I should try to explore different genres and not judge.</p>

        Hedonistic Treadmill: What It Means to Be Happy With What You Have
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Jan 2023</span>

    <script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>

<p><strong>Keywords: Random</strong></p>

<p>Basically, at some point or another we’ve probably heard of the saying <em>count your stars</em> or <em>be happy with what you have</em>. I recently learned about hedonistic treadmills and made me make a (probably not unique) connection to this saying. For those, unaware the <em>hedonistic treadmill</em> refers to the stability of one’s happiness regardless of events of positive and unhappy occurences. Essentially, the principle of the hedonistic treadmill says that after a positive or a negative event, we will feel some slight delta in happiness only to return back to where we were before. This is not to say that our happiness is the same regardless of our lives - improvements in living conditions of course improve happiness (generally) - but is more so to describe the fact that we are generally pretty stable.</p>

<p>Before we get to the adage in the title, it’s worth noting that the hedonistic treadmill (at least how I see it) is great at proving another adage about the journey and not the destination. By the hedonistic treadmill, if we wanted to maximize our happiness (like this is some sort of differentiable function idk?) working in jobs and progressing careers would be pretty irrelevant. However, many people find satisfaction from achieving their goals, even if they return to the same happiness before: this is pretty good proof that the journey leads to happiness more than the destination. Perhaps this is a higher-form of happiness like meaning or some other self-help buzzword. Ironically, this means that the hedonistic treadmill measuring happiness missed the fact that just traveling on this treadmill makes us happy. Who else is thinking that this type of satisfaction is an integral of the hedonistic treadmill’s sine waves??</p>

<p>I digress, but the returning of a baseline stands. We really can’t change this baseline happiness other than preventing negative events from taking hold and finding more positive events to genuinely celebrate. To do this, I guess it’s best to just be happy with have. I am still curious about its function though.</p>

<p>This article may have been kinda cringe 🙃 :D</p>

        Double Backpropagation: A Forgotten Algorithm
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Jan 2023</span>

    <script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>

<p><strong>Keywords: Backpropgation, Gradient Descent, Theoretical ML</strong></p>

<p>Hope you are enjoying the new year 2023! It’s been a while since I’ve uploaded a theoretical algorithm so here we are :)</p>

<p>I’ve made a few posts and challenges about typical first-order gradient descent that I think it’s time I move on to other aspects of ML. But before I do, here’s one last gradient-descent-ish article on a variant of standard optimization algorithms and my theory on its potential usefulness in generative models.</p>

<p>Double backpropagation was first created by Le Cun and Drucker in 1992 and since then has been widely dismissed (maybe for computational reasons).Introductory ML courses and books don’t even cover it, so perhaps this article will help explain some things.</p>

<h2 id="double-backpropagation-algorithm">Double Backpropagation Algorithm</h2>

<p>The name for double backpropagation is a little weird because it’s not actually backpropagation (basically gradient descent) applied twice but just an addition of another term in the objective function. For an objective function \(J\) to optimize parameters \(\theta\) on a training set \(X\) , the double backpropagation function \(J'\) is given by:</p>

\[J'(\theta) = J(\theta)  + \lambda \lVert \frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial X} \rVert^{2}\]

<p>It’s actually pretty simple. The new objective function is just the regular objective functive plus the differentiable L2-norm of the gradient of the regular objective function with respect to the input scaled by some <em>hyperparameter</em> (you choose the value) \(\lambda\).</p>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Double Backpropagation is motivated by forcing the parameters to be as generalizable as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More concretely, the value of the adjusted function \(J'\) does not care just about the performance of the model with the parameters \(\theta\) but also how stable they are. If the input \(X\) is changed slightly, the model’s performance (objective function \(J\)) should ideally not change much. This is similar to <em>augmentations</em> where we want the predictions (e.g. a cat image predicted as a cat) to be the same regardless of small changes in the input - both double backpropagation + augmentations try to <em>force</em> the model to be generalizable to differing input. This is of course helpful because when a model is deployed, the input the model will encounter may not be similar to the data gathered use for training.</p>

<p>This is why the (partial) derivative in the equation measures the model’s performance (objective function value) sensitivity to small changes in the input \(X\) is added. The algorithm is known as <em>double</em> backpropagation because a <a href="http://luiz.hafemann.ca/libraries/2018/06/22/pytorch-doublebackprop/">gradient of a gradient</a> is utilized.</p>

<h2 id="double-backpropagation-for-smooth-latent-spaces-">Double-Backpropagation for Smooth Latent Spaces (?)</h2>

<p>Just some background here. Generative models (for our purposes) are any type of model which takes in random vector input and generates some novel output. For example, a generative model \(G\) is a function that takes in a random generated vector \(\vec{x}\) and returns an image \(Y\).</p>

<p>Let’s say this generative model is trained through some black-box witchcraft (or a GAN training procedure) to generate images of people through these vectors. In this case, differing vectors will produce different people (e.g. different genders, races, body type, etc.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A latent space is the full extent of values the vector can take, where similar generated images will come from vectors which are near each other in this space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A short aside: one of the most underrated parts about machine learning is its ability to frame an infinite space (e.g. vector input values in a generative model) in a way that makes sense: similar output images are generated with vectors that are close to each other. More impressive, these computers don’t really know the meaning of words or images (they just see numbers) but can formulate a good understanding of the world.</p>

<p>Ideally in these models, the mapping of the input vector \(\vec{x}\) to the image \(Y\) learned by \(G\) is <em>smooth</em> - small changes in \(\vec{x}\) shouldn’t lead to drastic changes in \(Y\). Do you see where I am going with this?</p>

<p>Today was the last day of finals for me, and my final final was history. While preparing for it, I realized that there was something I had been thinking about for a good time now but just haven’t got around to writing about.</p>

<h2 id="how-history-is-taught">How History is Taught</h2>

<p>I’m confident the way that history is taught is the reason why so many students don’t enjoy it. We are expected to remember that the vague, narrative events we are reading about were actual deaths, actual soldiers, actual <em>people</em>. We see things as a series of chained events to understand, not an actual event that happened. When we read about the thousands of hands mutilated in the Congo we don’t even flinch, let alone feel the pain for one of our fingers to be removed. It’s not like the shock of assasinations, public statements, or word of mouth has changed for the last two thousands of years; but when we read about them in a sentence we feel nothing. This problem will only persist with history recorded for the 21th century if we let this continue.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The headlines of Roe v. Wade or Kanye West’s statements on InfoWars are sensational and beyond real: how would we feel if they just got summarized in a textbook as “The highly influential ruling by the Supreme Court led to radical protests across the country and for some marked the US complacency in progress.” Kinda bland, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps it’s too hard for us to even imagine these events as real without tangible proof. After all the worlds we learn about in history, like India’s partition or Chinese dynasties, are not only so physically far away for some of us but also extremely distant in the past. Textbooks only make this worse by condensing this into a very singular narrative of event <em>X</em> leading to War <em>Y</em> which resulted in the Treaty of <em>Z</em>. While many teachers in this generation have done away with memorizing dates for good, the underlying problem of emphasis on events and not experience is a problem.</p>

<p>Even if the problem of history feeling like a straight story to be told is inevitable, it still can be done better. What makes stories interesting to most people is not just the ability to explore a new world (which history by definition can give!) but also its power to make us feel something. History classes should try to make us feel the same thing as the people we are learning about did. The collective <em>psyche</em> of a nation during massive events is more moving than a description and at a level of deeper understanding.</p>

<p>Examples of this “psyche”:</p>
<ul>
  <li>After Columbine, people were frightened to send their children to school and provided them with directions home.</li>
  <li>After Jonestown, people mocked those killed as crazy and hell-driven.</li>
  <li>After 9/11, the America re-evaluated Bush as a serious president and some races tried their best to be hidden.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may have heard the saying “drink the Kool-aid”, but have you listened to the chilling Death Tape hours in Guyana before tragedy?</p>

<h2 id="my-solution-to-teach-history-better">(My) Solution To Teach History Better</h2>

<p>Pretty simple. Use primary source accounts. In fact, just have students read autobiographies like <em>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</em> detailing the experience of a slave or <em>Night</em> by a Holocaust survivor’s time in camp. Factual accounts are often seen as the peripheral or supplementary but that needs to change - textbook events / lectures should only be there to help give a basic way of thinking about the events at the time required to understand primary sources.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my opinion, this marks a shift away from history being about learning what happened in the past to <em>experiencing</em> it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the motivations for learning history we are commonly told is from the famous Santayana quote: ​“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” When we remember books or movies, we don’t remember what happened as much as what we felt when we went through them. History is likely no different: our years of education are numbered (well, for most of us), and if we want our experience in classroom history to be most fruitful for us to be able to cause future change it’s imperative that we remember them as best as possible. Heartstrings pull us into action, not words, and thus since reading first-hand sources is the best way to empathize with struggles in the past, it just may help prevent them from happening again. Otherwise, we are betting that we will remember numbers of tragedy decades later and furthermore, act on them.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Students should be thrilled to learn history. After all, it is the closest thing we have to time travel!</p>
