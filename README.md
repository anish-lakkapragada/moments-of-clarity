## *Moments of Clarity* has moved 

*Moments of Clarity* (MoC) was a semi-meme website I started in the fall of my junior year of high school (first commit: September 19th, 2022). It was available on `anish.lakkapragada.com`. MoC was made for fun and hosted 32 posts, various academic & non-academic PDFs, birding photos and media, and a lot of great high school memories.

Now being a first-year in college, I realize that my personal website, the pride of any self-respecting computer science major, cannot be so memeable. However, there is too much embarassing material on MoC for me to not make available to everyone; as such I am moving MoC to a new home at `old-anish.lakkapragada.com`. From now on I plan to write new blogs and host media on `anish.lakkapragada.com`, my new personal website. A few PDFs though will be ported from MoC to my new website as I think they are still relevant.

Special thanks to Abhinav "Bob" Raja, Marc Melyikan, Ronak Badhe, and all those who attempted our [ML Club Challenges](https://old-anish.lakkapragada.com/notes/).
